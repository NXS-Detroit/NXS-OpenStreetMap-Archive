Thank you for your interest in contributing!

I'm looking only for *errors in data consistency or legality* to be reported here. This means that I welcome issues and pull requests to fix:

* A change I announced not being implemented in the file
* A change I implemented in the file not being announced
* A bus route making an illegal maneuver

What's not appropriate for this repository:

* Suggested changes to service ([which should go here](https://github.com/NXS-Detroit/NXS-Suggestions/issues))
* General feedback on the system ([which should go here](https://twitter.com/NXSBusDetroit))
